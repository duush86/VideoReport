# 18032-video-report-generator
This sample uses the CMS API to generate a report on all the videos in your account in CSV format. It fetches the video data in batches of 100, so if there is an API timeout or some other error, you will still have some of the data.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:

<table>
	<thead>
		<th>File</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>index.html</td>
		<td>The sample as working HTML page</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>css/styles.css</td>
		<td>CSS used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>js/index.js</td>
		<td>JavaScript used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
</table>
